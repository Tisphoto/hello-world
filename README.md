 # hello-world
Learning a little gitHUB-ness furr me people
 ..A Wee bit about me-self#
 Im a wee little man, in comparison to tee vastsness of tee universe.
 Yet in my mind I am not nessisarily I, I really is === I + You + Them.
 For we as individuals all have the "unique ability to think from a singular
 view point, an illusionary vantage point that boldly etches our niche in the
 cosmos.
 
 Things that seem as though they are, for a lack of better words, stable, un-ending,
 and tattooed to my life for good. Though, I know, can be removed by lazer treatment. However,
 their is a slight problem in the removal process. This problem being that the scars 
 lasers leave during the procedure, as anyone who's ever seen someones "removed" tattoo will tell you
 or a simple google search will show you. It is a scar tissue riddled patch of skin unless covered by 
 ANOTHER TATTOO. 

 I am saying is PEOPLE, material items, and ideas, sometimes even reasoning is, if not violently
 darastically altered and found to be only in "the moment". The moment is now. Every word that you 
 are reading as you are reading it, your brain immediately recognizing the sequence of letters you see,
 and quickly forming it into thoughts and ideas expressed by another human being. A human being who is
 growing, experiencing, and the only thing that this being can firmly grasp hold of in the torrential 
 down-pour of the human life experience happing frame-by-frame, is the stark consistnecy in life's very
 inconsistency.
